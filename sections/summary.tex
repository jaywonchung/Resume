I am a fifth year PhD candidate in CSE at the University of Michigan, working with \href{https://mosharaf.com}{\myuline{Professor Mosharaf Chowdhury}}.
I build \textbf{efficient software systems for deep learning}, with a recent focus on the efficient management of not only time, but also \textbf{energy}.

I view power and energy as fundamental systems resources that are worth carefully optimizing and allocating, not only in hardware, but also from software.
Doing so provides automatic downstream benefits, such as reducing operational expenses, alleviating power delivery pressure for datacenters, and allowing the hardware to truly max out on performance.

I lead the \href{https://ml.energy}{\myuline{ML Energy initiative}} as part of my research and open-source work.
