# Jae-Won's Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX sources for my Resume.

I used to compile the sources on Overleaf, from which I have obtained the CV template. Now, I have setup a Github Action on the repo, which automatically compiles and releases my documents.

The latest version of my Resume will always be available on the following link:

> https://github.com/jaywonchung/Resume/releases/latest/download/resume.pdf

Compiles are only triggered when the phrase "[Compile]" is in the commit message.
